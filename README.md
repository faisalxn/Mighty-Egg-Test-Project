# Mighty Egg Test Project

This project shows a leader board of a game.

Players daily scores are given in an excel file. This app read data from excel file.

For reading data from excel file we used jexcel library.

After reading data we calculated scores for each user of this week and all time.

Users rank is shown in a list by descending order.

1st, 2nd, 3rd position users are also shown in a podium.

For showing the list we created a customer adapter.

App user can know two types of rank "This Week" and "All Time". This is implemented using swaping adapters in button click.

For design some svg file is used.

For convenience of app user we assigned three images for each user.
